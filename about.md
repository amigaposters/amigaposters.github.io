Welcome to **Amiga Posters & Artwork** by *Vasilis Psomiadis!*
<br><br>
This site contains beautiful retro posters and related artwork about some of the most revolutionary home computers of the 80s and early 90s: the **Commodore Amiga** family! All the available images are done by me, either as recreations of original Commodore posters, packaging, cover boxes, print ads, brochures and catalogs about the Amiga or as my own design concepts and ideas inspired by visual material of the Amiga era.
<br><br>
So, browse my website and relive those wonderful childhood memories! And why not download anything you fancy and go decorate your walls? Your retro corner deserves a bit of personal touch, doesn’t it?
<br><br>
Either way, let’s take a trip down memory lane and recall the time when computers were fun to use and play with!
<br><br>
A passionate Amiga owner since 1988.
