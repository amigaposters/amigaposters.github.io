The Amiga personal computer was introduced in July 1985 by Commodore International. The first model, the **Amiga 1000** was a computer that embodied the vision of its creators about a machine with hardware and software technological advances that could provide state-of-the-art multimedia capabilities and a computing experience like no other near its price segment. It was truly a computer way ahead of its time!
<br><br>
That concept, was also captured in Commodore’s marketing efforts where  slogans like ‘*Amiga. The computer for the creative mind*‘ and ‘*Amiga. Gives you a creative edge*‘ were used. The Amiga architecture utilized custom designed chips that provided its special graphical and musical abilities.

In 1987, Commodore released the low cost **Amiga 500** model which made a successful entry into the home micros market. It was the model with most sales of the Amiga family worldwide (estimated around 5-6 millions) and also my first Amiga computer, bought in late 1988. The Amiga 500 offered the same capabilities with the A1000 but in a case with integrated keyboard, a design followed by most of the home micros in the 80s.  At the same time a big box model, called **Amiga 2000**, is introduced which, while posses the same technical capabilities, offers plentiful of expansion options.

The next model comes in 1990 with the **Amiga 3000** machine – the most powerful Amiga model so far – sporting a sexy desktop case, that marks it as one of the most beautiful Amiga designs ever made. On the budget line, Commodore released the **Amiga 500+** in 1991, which was superseded by **Amiga 600** the next year. All these models utilize the enhanced chip set (ECS) which is an improved version of the original Amiga custom chips (OCS).

Back in 1991 Commodore also made a debut with the – then new – optical media, the CDROM. Their effort led to the release of a consumer based device, named Commodore **CDTV**, targeting the home-entertainment market.
<br><br>
In the last quarter of 1992, a new significantly improved model comes into the light, named **Amiga 1200**. This new Amiga comes with the third generation custom chip set called *Advanced Graphics Architecture* (AGA). Along with the home-computer market oriented A1200, a new big desktop model is introduced, which also sports the AGA chip set, the **Amiga 4000**.

In September of 1993 the last member of the Amiga family was released. It was the **Amiga CD32**. It was the first 32-bit home video games console released in the world and Commodore tried to position it against a very competitive game consoles market of the early 90’s. Unfortunately accumulated financial problems and questionable business-strategy decisions led to Commodore’s bankruptcy a few months later in April 1994.
