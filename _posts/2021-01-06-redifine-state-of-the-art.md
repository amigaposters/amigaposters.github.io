My latest poster is a recreation of a Commodore original print ad for the great **Amiga 500**. Indeed a machine that **redifined the state of the art** in home computing back at 1987 when it was released. At US$699 the Amiga offered incredible value to the user with its advanced graphics, sound and computing capabilities. Of course video games was a domain that all these features could be exploited to the delight of all young owners of the Amiga!
