My second Amiga poster concerns the recreation of a classic Commodore ad back from 1985 again for the first Amiga computer, the Amiga 1000. This ad praises the top graphical and sound abilities of the Amiga thanks to its special custom chips and ingenious hardware engineering.
<br><br>
The three custom chips were given by the Amiga designers team the female names of **Agnus**, **Denise** and **Paula**. Agnus controls all access to grphics memory (called chip RAM in Amiga terminology), Denise is the main video processor and Paula the audio handling chip.
