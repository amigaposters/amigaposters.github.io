On the Christmas of 1988 I've got the greatest present from my parents: an awesome Amiga 500!
<br><br>
I vividly recall my impatience to receive my present and afterwards my excitement that I was the lucky owner of such an incredible computer. With schools closed and a heavy snowing weather limiting outside activities I've spent almost all of the holidays exploring the magic world of Amiga!

Winter Nights is a nostalgic trip back to that memories. It uses the PAL high-resolution screen mode, meaning 640x512 pixels, in 16 colors. Created entirely with Personal Paint 7.1 running in WinUAE.
