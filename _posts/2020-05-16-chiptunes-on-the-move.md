Sony released their original **Walkman** portable cassette player in 1979 and they truly changed the music listening habits of a whole generation!
<br><br>
The first tracking software, "*The Ultimate Soundtracker*" by **Krasten Obarski** was built for the Amiga in 1987. What if Sony decided to tap on the power of computer synthesized music via tracking tools and build a player to support this concept? Wouldn't be cool if Sony seized the opportunity to support playback of user-created digital music and cooperate with big names of the home computer market such was Commodore?  Based on this "*what if*" scenario I have created a poster ad for the first micro floppydisk portable player by Sony able to playback mod tunes the users could create on their Amiga computers!
<br><br>
Now imagine to be able to listen to your favorite chiptunes on the move back in the 80s!
