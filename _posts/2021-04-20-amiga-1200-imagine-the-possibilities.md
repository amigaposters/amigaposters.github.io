My latest poster concerns the lovel **Amiga 1200** model. While it is true that the introduction of the AGA chipset, that this model is equiped with, was "too little, too late" to allow Amiga to compete in the early 90s home computer market with cheap PC compatibles and new generation gaming consoles, the 1200 is a great compact system to own for any Amiga fan! Adding a relative cheap fast RAM trapdoor expansion and using some flash storage media on the internal IDE port you can turn it into a mean **WHDL-compatible** machine that can run almost any title of the wide Amiga games library.<br><br>
The awesome pixel art displayed on the 1084S monitor is called "Shattered Harmony" and is created by the demo artist **Prowler**. It won the first place in Datastorm 2011 Amiga-graphics compo. You can check out Prowler's superb artwork <a href="http://artcity.bitfellas.org/index.php?a=artist&id=762" target="_blank">here</a>
