The **Alien Breed** games were a fantastic shooters released in the 90s for the Amiga by **Team 17**. They were top quality titles and all of them were well accepted and best selling games on the platform. The **Special Edition '92**, the second of the series, was released on 1992 and expanded on the original version. This was one of my favorite Amiga games back in the day that gave many happy hours of gameplay. So, back in 2018 I've decided to create a poster as homage to this awesome Amiga title. For some reason which I can't fathom now, I didn't publish this poster on my website before today (probably it was just forgotten!).
