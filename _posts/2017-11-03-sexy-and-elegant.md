The sixth poster is about the sexiest Amiga model in existence, the desktop **Amiga 3000**!
<br><br>
I have to confess that this one had me quite troubled as I couldn’t locate an original Commodore ad that would be aesthetically satisfactory. It’s kind of sad that such a good looking and powerful machine wasn’t promoted by Commodore with visually appealing ads. So, I decided to create a new poster from scratch **based on a dutch Commodore promotional brochure** about Amiga 3000.
<br><br>
I think the final result came out pretty neat and highlights the aesthetics of this beautiful Amiga model.
<br><br>
I truly hope it meets your expectations too!
