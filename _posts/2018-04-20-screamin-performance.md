The **Vampire Apollo Accelerators** are a new breed of FPGA-based hardware for the classic Amigas.
<br><br>
This poster is inspired by the ultimate performance (in comparison with Amiga legacy hardware) brought to the Amiga retro scene by the Vampire accelerator boards. The two released accelerators so far, **Vampire 600 V2** and **Vampire 500 V2+**, offer never before seen performance to the humble Amiga 600 and 500 models respectively. The accelerator uses Altera’s Cyclone FPGA with the Apollo 68080 Core which is code compatible with the classic Motorola 68K processors but enhanced with some new features. By the sayings of Vampire users these little boards offer the possibility to do things never imagined possible by the Amiga. More importantly the team behind this project is dedicated to continue delivering new features and further models to the Vampire hardware line.
