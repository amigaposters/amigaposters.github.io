Two additional promotional Amiga stickers recreated for your enjoyment!
<br><br>
The first one is the "AMIGA FEVER" sticker from a promotional campaign by Commodore Germany, one of the best-selling Amiga markets. The second one is the "AMIGA 500 Computer Of The Year 1990" sticker from the award that was given to the best-selling Amiga model by the German computer magazine CHIP. As was the case also with my previous stickers, these are recreated in vector format so they will print in perfect quality in what ever size you want to!<br><br>
