The second game of the infamous **Turrican series** was released for the Amiga in 1991 and it is considered one of the best shooter games of the platform.
<br><br>
Based on a concept by **Manfred Trenz** it was developed by **Factor 5** and published under **Rainbow Arts**. The game possessed impressive technical maturity and excellent implementation that demonstrated really well the graphics and sound capabilities of the Amiga. Multi-directional scrolling, colorful copper effects, huge sprites, fast-paced action, lots of sound effects and a fabulous musical score composed by **Chris HÃ¼lsbeck** made an iconic game still enjoyed today by many Amiga fans!

My poster is a touch-up of the awesome original cover art made by **Celal Kandemiroglu**, the great artist behind lot of covers of well known video games including the Turrican series.
