During the lifetime of **Amiga 500** Commodore introduced a lot of bundles with software titles to attract more sales. It seemed that regional Commodore offices were allowed to create bundles that they believed suitable for their own market. One of the most sucessful bundles was the Batman Pack that Commodore UK came up with in the fall of 1989. Their deal allowed them to include **Batman The Movie**, a major movie concersion title by **Ocean Software**, simultaneously with its retail release.<br>
The Batman Pack also contained 3 additional titles, namely **The New Zealand Story**, a coin-op conversion also by Ocean, **Interceptor** an acclaimed flight simulator by **Electronic Arts** and the second release of the infamous Amiga's killer app **Deluxe Paint II**. All these, for the total price of 399.99 GBP. The Batman Pack proved a huge success in the UK during the Christmas 1990 season and between October 1989 and September 1990 managed to sell around 200,000 units.<br>
My poster could be a print ad to promote this pack in the computer and video games magazines of the era. Many thanks to my friend **Nick Kary**, for providing the photos of his original Batman Pack sleeve, which I've used in this!<br><br>
