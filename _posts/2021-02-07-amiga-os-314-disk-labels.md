It's amazing that the classic 68k Amiga OS had an update released a couple of years ago aimed at optimizing things, fixing many known bugs and adding some much needed new features.
<br><br>
This release, published by <a href="https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/where-to-buy/direct-downloads/188-amigaos-314">Hyperion Entertainment CVBA</a>, got the version 3.1.4 and was received with much enthusiasm from the Amiga community. As was to be expected this was offered as a digital download (although some 3rd party Amiga dealers also offered the option of purchasng physical disks). Many of the users obtaining the updated AmigaOS opted to write their downloaded images to physical media and understandably its always nice to accompany those disks with good-looking labels! With this in mind I have created a complete set of 8 labels for the following disks: Workbench, Install, Extras, Fonts, Storage, Locale, Modules and the released minor Update to v3.1.4.1.
<br><br>
Now you don't have an excuse not to write your disk images to a set of NOS double-density disks!
