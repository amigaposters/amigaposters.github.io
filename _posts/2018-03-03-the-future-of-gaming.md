The **Amiga CD32**, released in late 1993, was Commodore’s attempt into the gaming consoles world.
<br><br>
Commodore saw the fast growing market of game consoles and tried to capitalize on its Amiga-line large gaming base by releasing a 32-bit console sharing similar specs with the Amiga 1200 and utilizing CDROM media. While the console was promising and everyone hoped it will give Commodore a much needed sales boost, things soon went downhill and Commodore’s bankruptcy came in April 1994.
<br><br>
Today’s poster is my own creation of a could-be Amiga CD32 print ad. Using some classic design elements of the time period, I’ve tried to give it a retro feeling.
<br><br>
With no further delays I’ll let you enjoy **Europe’s first 32-bit games console**!
<br><br>
Enjoy it and don’t forget to *stay in the fast lane!*
