Today's post is about recreating two promotional Amiga stickers made by Commodore!
<br><br>
The first one is the "Computer Of The Year 1986" sticker and the other one the "Kiss me, AMIGA" sticker that was included on the original Amiga 500 packaging sold in Germany. These are recreated as vector graphics so they will print in perfect quality in what ever size you want!<br><br>
