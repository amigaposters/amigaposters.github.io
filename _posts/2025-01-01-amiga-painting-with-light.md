Some time after I got my Amiga in the late 80s I remember reading an interview in a magazine where an artist explained that using a computer to create visual art was like painting with light directly and that was something amazing compared to painting with traditional media.
<br><br>
Back in 1986, when the Amiga 1000 launched, few personal computers could rival what it offered in terms of graphics—especially at a comparable price point. Two years later, the introduction of the Amiga 500 made this level of graphics performance even more accessible to a wider audience. Although Amiga’s graphics advantage didn’t remain unmatched forever, it undeniably lowered the entry barrier for many enthusiasts and creators, opening up a world of possibilities.
<br><br>
Thanks to its superior video capabilities, Amiga users were fortunate to have many options for creating computer graphics and digital art. Many of the software titles developed for creative users on the Amiga were nothing short of revolutionary for their time, setting new standards in digital creativity and inspiring a generation of artists.
<br><br>
Below, I’ve highlighted some well-known Amiga paint programs and iconic images that, in my view, are inseparably tied to the rich history of the machine itself.
<br><br>
Best wishes for a creative and inspiring 2025 filled with joy and imagination!
