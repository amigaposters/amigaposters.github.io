In March 1987 Commodore introduced the third model of the Amiga family, the **Amiga 2000**.
<br><br>
The 2000 was a big box Amiga with a huge desktop case and a separate keyboard. It was created with expandability in mind and aimed at the business/professional office market. For the lower-end home market Commodore launched the Amiga 500 at the same year. Thus covering both ends of the market and ensuring the continuation of the Amiga family after the original Amigaâ€™s debut, almost 2 years before.

My poster is a re-creation of the front cover of Commodore Germany official catalog **The Big Amiga Yearbook 1987**. 300 pages containing software & hardware products presentations along with various articles and hints & tips for the Amiga computers.
