Yep, Christmas is almost here and it seems the **festive mood** has increased my creativity!
<br><br>
Thus, I thought why not make another wallpaper that combines Amiga memories with the season’s holiday theme? And of course Christmas and Amiga always bring in my mind the awesome **Holidays Lemmings** release of 1993 by **DMA Design**! Who can resist to little Lemmings sprites dressed with Santa Claus outfits going around snowy levels, right?
<br><br>
So, what are you waiting for? Give your desktop a holidays look and **enjoy the most wonderful time of the year**!
