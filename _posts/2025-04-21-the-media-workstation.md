**Amiga 3000**, Commodore’s ambitious leap into workstation territory, was launched in 1990, nearly 5 years after the original Amiga made its debut.<br><br>
This multimedia powerhouse came with the first serious attempt to evolve the original Amiga chipset and featured a significantly enhanced, sleek, and more professional version of AmigaOS.
<br><br>
But was it too little, too late?
<br><br>
One thing’s certain, the Amiga 3000 remains one of the most sought-after models in the Amiga family to this day.
<br><br>
For this poster I've experiment with a scanned image from the cover of the Amiga 3000 User Manual, playing with media, colours and light. I hope you'll enjoy the playful and vibrant outcome!
