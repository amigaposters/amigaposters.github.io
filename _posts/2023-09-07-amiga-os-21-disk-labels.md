In the end of 1992 Commodore circulated a software-only update for it's Amiga OS Release 2. Version 2.1 of the Amiga OS contained fixes and improvements as well as support for some new drivers and utilities aimed at the more 'serious' Amiga users. It was initially shipped with the Amiga 600 but it was also made available for all Amiga models that supported 2.04/2.05 Kickstart ROM (required to run all versions of Amiga OS Release 2).

My recreated set of labels contains both the normal and the international releases of the OS.
