Another popular pack by Commodore was **Cartoon Classics** released in 1991 first with **Amiga 500** and later with **Amiga 500 Plus** machines.
<br><br>
This bundle incldued three games, namely **The Simpsons**, **Captain Planet and the Planeteers** and **Lemmings** along with the infamous drawing program **Deluxe Paint III** by Electronic Arts. I guess the bundle name was derived from the two game titles that were based on popular cartoon TV series combined with the cartoonish feeling of Lemmings and the ability of Deluxe Paint to enable users to create their own digital animations.
<br><br>
From my research this pack has been released both in a box form and as a sleeve for the standard Amiga 500 original packaging. Here I have recreated the front cover of the box version so you can enjoy it in its high resolution glory!
