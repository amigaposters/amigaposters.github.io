Finally the **Amiga 600** makes an appearance on one of my recreated posters!
<br><br>
Amiga 600 (codenamed “June Bug”), the most compact Amiga model, was actually Commodore’s try in producing a cut-down cost wise home computer that would repeat the success of the Amiga 500 as a budget machine. However, things didn’t go as planned (they rarely do) and A600 ended up costing more than the A500 while not offering that much over the “previous” generation.
<br><br>
This poster is inspired by the **Zool** software-pack box-art that Commodore included with the Amiga 600. This bundle included the megahit game Zool of **Gremlin Graphics**, a British software house of the 80s and 90s that released several 8-bit and 16-bit hits, along with two other games, Striker and Pinball Dreams, and the TransWrite word processor by GoldDisk.
