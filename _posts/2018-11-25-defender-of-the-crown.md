Is there anyone, back at the days, who owned an Amiga and didn’t felt amazed at the capabilities of his/her new awesome home computer while staring at the visuals of **Defender of the Crown**?
<br><br>
**Cinemaware**‘s game productions were heavily based on a movie-like presentation style emphasizing graphics, sound and action scenario. Defender of the Crown was their first release in 1986 and the Amiga version naturally featured the best graphics. Some legends in the Amiga scene, such as **R.J. Mical** and **Jim Sachs** were involved with the creation of the game. While featuring a simplified gameplay, the – unparalleled at the time of its release – graphics and animation quality along the original atmospheric soundtrack, made the press call it an impressive showcase demonstrating the power and technical superiority of the Amiga. The game was a huge commercial success and ported to many other computer platforms and consoles through the years.

This poster is a homage on the game – *which was one of the main reasons I wanted an Amiga back in 1988* – and contains elements from the beautiful official cover art as well as screen shots from the actual game.
