It is some time since I’ve made a new poster but tonight I felt the urge to create something different. In my retro memory there is one arcade racing game that stands really high: **Outrun**.
<br><br>
This awesome Sega arcade coin-op has known a huge success and was made available for many home-computer systems, the Amiga being among them. Who can forget running against time in a **Ferrari Testarossa** with a pretty girl next to you? I am sure almost all of you have seen or played this racing game either in your Amiga or the original arcade system. If not go and try it now!
<br><br>
With that line of thinking in mind I have created the new poster using concepts from Outrun.
<br><br>
Enjoy it and don’t forget to *stay in the fast lane!*
