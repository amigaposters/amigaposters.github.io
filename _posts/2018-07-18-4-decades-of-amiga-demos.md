Here is another CD cover for an awesome demo compilation made by <a href="https://patreon.com/AmigaJay" target="_blank">AmigaJay</a> called “**4 Decades Of Amiga Demos**“.
<br><br>
The incredible pixel art of Eddie I’ve used comes from the “**Stuck Somewhere in Time**” demo release which was the winner of November 2014 at the Compusphere demo party (its a tribute to Iron Maiden and a great demo – you can watch it <a href="\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEG3fdV6Ra4" target="_blank">here</a>) while the copper cube and diamond are elements from the “**Mental Hangover**” Amiga demo by the **Scoopex** group.
<br><br>
The logo was hand-drawn by me and then image-processed via Photoshop.
