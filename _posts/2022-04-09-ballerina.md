Ballet encombass art, elegance, charm and grace.

I guess back in 1985, Commodore wanted to highlight that its newly launched Amiga personal computer, combined an impressive set of features and characteristics that allowed it to be connected with creativity and the arts as no other computer before it. Therefore, I present my new poster - of the Amiga model that started it all! - inspired by Amiga's launch and the official marketing brochure of the machine.
