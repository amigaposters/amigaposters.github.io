These two versions of **AmigaOS** were the last ones released by Commodore for the Amiga. Version 3.0 was released in 1992 and shipped together with the newly introdocued AGA models - the **Amiga 1200** and the **Amiga 4000**. Version 3.1 was made available in 1994 as an upgrade for all Amiga models but it was an unfinished release, since Commodore rushed it out to market looking to collect some extra revenue, even though development was not 100% complete.
