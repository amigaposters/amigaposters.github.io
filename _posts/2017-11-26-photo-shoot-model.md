I present you the 7th recreated Amiga poster! It is a lovely photo shoot of the most popular Amiga model, the 500. This was a request from my friend Nick Kary who provided the original image. ðŸ˜Š
<br><br>
The moment I saw the image Nick sent me I knew I had to make this poster happen! But this was a **challenging and really time-consuming project** as almost every object in the picture (except the photo of my trusty Amiga 500 and of course the *Ferrari Formula One* game screenshot) was created **from scratch** in Photoshop! Iâ€™m really proud of the result and I believe it matches the original pretty well.
<br><br>
I hope you like it also. ðŸ™‚
