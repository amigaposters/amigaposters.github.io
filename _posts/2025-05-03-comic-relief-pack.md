Another recreation of an original Commodore UK bundle for the **Amiga 1200**!
<br><br>
Sales of the Comic Relief Pack was officially supporting the Comic Relief charity in the UK. The bundle included an Amiga 1200 in standard configuration and the official Comic Relief video game, which was **Sleepwalker** a platformer published by **Ocean Software**.
