Undoubtedly the Amiga was a favorite among creative computer users.
<br><br>
Its advanced technical capabilities along with the excellent price-point made it a clear choice when it came to digital creativity in the 80s. Many people – later to became digital artists – were inspired by the Amiga and its creative power. Myself included was always awed at the prospect of producing beautiful graphics, animations and music with my Amiga and spent enough hours tinkering with creativity software, learning and having fun!
<br><br>
This poster is a recreation of a favorite original Commodore one, that depicts in a brilliant way the disruption introduced by the Amiga 1000 in the digital creative world of the 80s. I’ve worked on this for several hours during a period of almost a month since a large part of the poster is painted by hand using Corel Draw and Adobe Photoshop. Dedicated to all the Amiga users who felt that spark of creativity using their machines back in the day – and of course to those that still do!
<br><br>
Last but not least, hopefully it will find a spot on the wall of my friend Polychronis Skarlatos (*now you don’t have excuses mate*).
