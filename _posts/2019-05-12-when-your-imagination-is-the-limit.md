Did you drool over the possibilities an awesome home computer like the **Amiga 500** would give you when you read about it and its software (both games and applications) in the 80s computer magazines? I surely did!
<br><br>
Indeed in my teenager mind that little piece of technology was a gateway into a world of endless entertainment and unlimited creativity! As Commodore’s marketing put it: “your imagination is the limit”
<br><br>
Inspired by that moto of the following advert, which was also used in one of the first Amiga 500 bundles along with a graphics package called **Photon Paint**, I’ve re-created the poster bellow:
<br><br>

<span style="font-size:small; font-style: italic">Amiga 500 – Your imagination is the limit! (left original / right re-created)</span>
<br><br>
