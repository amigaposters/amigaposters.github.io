I thought it would be nice to recreate some additional system disk labels that Commodore bundled with various Amiga models.
<br><br>
Following the evolution of Amiga OS and the various released versions these labels used various designs and evolved along with the OS. Moreover Commodore used various colouring schemes to indicate localized versions of the 1.x release of the OS (Amiga OS 2.x and beyond supports localization natively). I've tried to make these as faithful to the originals as possible based on photos of the disks I've found online. Again, simply print the image in self-adhesive A4 paper and use the guides to cut the labels!
