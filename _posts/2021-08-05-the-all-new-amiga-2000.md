My latest poster is dedicated to the **Amiga 2000**, the model that provided the most expansion options (beyond the tower models of course) to its user.<br><br>
My recreation is based on the cover of an original Commodore broschure for the Amiga 2000/2500 computers. I recreated the exact photographic elements present in the original material and added some extra text to make it more appealing and informative as a standalone poster. I hope you approve of the result!
