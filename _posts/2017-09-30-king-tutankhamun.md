After resurrecting my good old Amiga 500 in the middle of summer 2017 and while trying to setup  again a retro computing experience, the idea of decorating my little retro corner was forming slowly in my mind. My initial thought was to print some nice looking Amiga related photos, frame them and hung them in my wall. This is where I realized that while there is available online a lot of visual material for the Amiga not everything is suitable for printing (low resolution, poor scans, wrong coloring & lightning, etc). Therefore the next step for me was to try and create (or recreate) Amiga posters ready to print. There was some Commodore original material used in various media (mostly magazine ads, some brochures and catalogs, equipment packaging) and also from third party hardware and software companies producing for the Amiga and material created by users and fans as well.

For my first effort I chose an original 1985 Commodore print ad for the **Amiga 1000** with the iconic picture of **King Tutankhamun** as was drawn in the famous paint program **Deluxe Paint** by Electronic Arts.
