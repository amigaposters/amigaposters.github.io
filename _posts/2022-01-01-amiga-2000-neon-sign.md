New year, new poster about the mighty **Commodore Amiga 2000**!
<br><br>
The second model of the Amiga family sports a huge motherboard housing the original Amiga chipset along with several Zorro-II and ISA slots that offer a great veriety of expansion and upgrade options. This like-a-tank desktop Amiga build has its own special appeal among Amiga enthusiasts. My poster is based on an idea about creating a Commodore Amiga neon sign. I hope you approve the result!
