The fourth recreated original Commodore Amiga poster is about the big box **Amiga 2000**. This model shares exactly the same hardware capabilities as the A500 but obviously offers plenty more expansion possibilities. Commodore positioned it as the business oriented Amiga family member of the time.

As it was impossible to source the photos originally used by Commodore’s marketing department some 30 years ago I tried to create something visually similar with available images. My intention was for the end result to be as close to the original poster’s feel as possible and I believe I succeeded.
