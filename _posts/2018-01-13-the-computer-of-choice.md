Poster No. 12 and it’s the good old **Amiga 500** again! The home computer that brought hundreds of powerful creative applications to the average user in the late 80s.
<br><br>
The moment I laid my eyes on this original Commodore Spain advert for the A500 I knew I had to remake that poster. So here it is with some catchy translated text!
<br><br>
I hope you’ll enjoy it!
