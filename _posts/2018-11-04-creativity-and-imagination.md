To many users, the **Amiga 500** with its low acquisition cost and some powerful features – for an 80’s home computer – was undoubtedly the ticket to a world of digital creativity with their imagination being the only limit!
<br><br>
Commodore’s marketing tried to push that idea and has created some beautiful posters on that concept. My latest poster is a recreation of such a print ad that I found online. While I wanted to be as true as possible to the original version I’ve included some new elements which in my opinion blend nice with the original image and don’t alter its character. The work required on this poster was quite demanding and time consuming (but always fun!) and some of the graphics were first created on the vector drawing program CorelDRAW and then imported to Photoshop for detailing and composition.

I hope you’ll enjoy my work as much as I’ve enjoyed making it!
