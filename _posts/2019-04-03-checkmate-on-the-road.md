Now, if you were an Amiga user back in 1989 the name ‘Checkmate’ would probably remind you of something, wouldn’t?
<br><br>
Yep, it was that nice expansion case which transformed your all-in-one design Amiga 500 into a desktop computer! Jump 30 year later and my good friend Stephen Jones has successfully launch a new Checkmate A1500 Plus desktop case through a  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/483774293/amiga-3000-inspired-modular-amiga-pc-desktop-compu?ref=discovery&term=checkmate" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>! This great modern desktop case is based on the Amiga 3000 looks and can support both original Amiga and newer hardware.
<br><br>
You can visit <a href="https://checkmate1500plus.com" target="_blank">checkmate1500plus.com</a> for the details and awesome features of this great product. Even better you can admire it up close following Steve’s series of presentations of his new case on various Amiga gatherings and shows!
<br><br>
To help Steve I’ve created a promo poster for public display on these events. I’ve went for a full 300-dpi ISO A1 size here (that’s a whopping 30MP image) with an 80’s retro inspired theme. The first Amiga gathering is the <a href="https://www.southwestamiga.org.uk/2019/02/announcing-swag-meet-9/" target="_blank">South-West Amiga Group #9 meeting</a> taking place in Dodington Parish Hall, Chipping Sodbury at Saturday 18th May, 2019.

By the way, if you missed the Kickstarter you can contact Steve through his website and declare interest for a case coming with subsequent production batches (if there is enough demand).
