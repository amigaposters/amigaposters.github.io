One more original Commodore UK bundle for the **Amiga 1200** gets the recreation treatment!
<br><br>
This time its the back cover used in the **Computer Combat Pack** for the Amiga 1200. Unlike the front, which focused on cartoonish visuals targetting the gaming crowd, this side highlights the serious capabilities of the new Amiga. It showcases the power of the AGA chipset to create colorful documents with **Wordworth** by **Digita International**, a powerful professional word processor included in the bundled software.<br><br>
Enjoy my recreated back cover in all its high-resolution glory!
