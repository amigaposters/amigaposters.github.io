Desert Sunset was my entry for the Pixel Art category of the <a href="https://amigausers.ie/winners-of-the-commodore-creative-competition-at-amiga-ireland-2020/" target="_blank">Commodore Creative Competition at Amiga Ireland 2020</a>, where it won the 2nd place. It was created entirely with Personal Paint 7.1 running on WinUAE and uses a resolution of 640x512 pixels with 16 colours.
