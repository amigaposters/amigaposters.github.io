**Sid Meier’s Pirates!** was one of the most popular computer games in the late 80s.
<br><br>
This acclaimed game published by **Microprose** was originally created for Commodore 64 and soon ported to almost every major computer platform, including the Amiga in 1990. The game put the player in the role of a young buccaneer in the golden age of the Caribbean piracy. Naval battles, sword fighting, plundering, treasure hunting, diplomacy and romance was the order of the day making for a truly addictive gameplay. The **Pirates! Gold** remake was released on the Amiga CD32 in 1994 with extra missions and an enhanced CD soundtrack. I admit that myself was very much into Pirates! and spend lots of happy hours pirating between Port Royale, Tortuga, Curacao and Santiago!
