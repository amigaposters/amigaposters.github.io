Now, wouldn’t be cool if there exist a **Commodore Amiga retail store** where you could admire and buy all shiny NOS Amigas and other retro software and equipment?
<br><br>
Thankfully in the digital sphere your imagination is the only limit and almost anything is possible! So, I went ahead and created a poster of a window display of such a Commodore Amiga store. Someone can dream, right?
<br><br>
BTW this marks my first poster in landscape orientation.
