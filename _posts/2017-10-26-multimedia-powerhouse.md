The fifth poster deals with another big box model, the might **Amiga 4000**. This time, instead of faithful recreating an original Commodore poster I tried a different approach: I based my design on an Amiga 4000 ad and added some new elements.
<br><br>
My effort is based on an original german Amiga 4000 advert praising it’s **strong multimedia capabilities**. I used pictures of the well-known Amiga graphics artist **Jim Sachs** (I simply love his pixel-art) and a 3d rendered A4000 model from Piotr Zgodziński (check out his <a href="http://www.zgodzinski.com/" target="_blank">awesome work</a>). The contained text is part of an original Commodore Amiga 4000 introductory ad in the US press. This mix gave an end result which I think preserves much of the original advert design but at the same time brings a gust of fresh air.
<br><br>
I hope you will enjoy it!
