Today's poster is a recreation of a cover page of the infamous German magazine **Amiga Magazin**. It was used on their debut special issue that covered **CeBIT '87**, one of the largest computer expos in Europe, held annually in Hanover, Germany. There, Commodore Germany anounced the release of the cheap and compact **Amiga 500** for the home computing market, and the serious, big-box expandable **Amiga 2000** for the business world. Both machines promised their users an amazing set of features and new possibilities for a fraction of the price of other systems!
