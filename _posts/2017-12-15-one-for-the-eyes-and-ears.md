The 8th poster tries to recreate one of the inspired old-school Commodore ads that appeared in the press when the Amiga 500 was released. Commodore focused on the **excellent graphics and sound capabilities of the Amiga 500** which were impressive for a home computer of its era.
<br><br>
Here I aimed at creating a poster that is as close to the original as possible. Please take notice that the actual Commodore material consists of two half-page ads (in different pages). I have merged them on the same page to create a single A4 poster.
<br><br>
I hope you like it also. ðŸ™‚
