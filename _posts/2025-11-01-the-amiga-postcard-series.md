Publications like **Amiga Power** and **Amiga Format** sometimes featured small collectable **postcards** that captured the spirit of the Amiga and some of its great game titles. Inspired by those, I’ve started creating my own series of numbered postcards celebrating my favourite Amiga games.
<br><br>
The first four in the collection feature the classics **Lemmings**, **Rocket Ranger**, **Speedball**, and **North & South**. Each design was printed on glossy photo paper with my trusty inkjet printer. The goal is to honor the art, imagination, and charm that made these games so memorable.
<br><br>
Designing and printing these cards has been a rewarding creative break, and I plan to continue expanding the series over time. It’s a small way to revisit the joy of the Amiga and share a bit of that nostalgia with others who remember it just as fondly.
