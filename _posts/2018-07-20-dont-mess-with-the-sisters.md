**The Great Giana Sisters** is a classic platformer game that <a href="http://pixelglass.org" target="_blank">ReImagine Games</a> gave it an unofficial total makeover!
<br><br>
With addictive gameplay and a catchy tune it was one of my old-time favorite games for the Amiga. The enhanced special edition released by the awesome people at ReImagine Games includes spiced-up graphics with new tiles, animation frames and palettes, new sound effects and even a new intro!

Here is my try on the CD cover for the Amiga CD32 version of the game:
