The eleventh poster concerns **Commodore’s CDTV**, a device that targeted the living room. Aspiring to merge entertainment and multimedia utilizing the -new then- CD optical media and backed by the Amiga’s hardware, CDTV sported a consumer device looks.
<br><br>
My poster is based on an original Commodore advert with a few minor additions and changes, to emphasize the Amiga ‘heart’ (*essentially an Amiga 500*) of the device.
