Yep, its time for some more recreated stickers! A really sticky summer this year so it deserves at lead a couple more of Amiga stickers!
<br><br>
I was made aware of these original (I suppose) designs when I saw them randomly online. It was love at first sight so they were added to my material-for-inspiration directory immediately!
The first has that 90s vibe with the skate boarding teen figure promoting the greatest home computer ever, the Amiga 500! The other one is based on the limited edition new art design of the Amiga 500 created by Stefanie Tucker for the German Amiga market.<br><br>
