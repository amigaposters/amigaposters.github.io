The **Amiga 500 Appetizer Kit** was an Amiga 500 bundle released in Italy around 1990.
<br><br>
The bundle was based on a productivity software suite by Gold Disk which included a text editor, a paint and a music creation software and a puzzle game. Gold Disk was one Amiga publisher dedicated to productivity software on the platform with several releases over the years.
<br><br>
Here I have recreated the front cover for you to enjoy!
