The **Amiga 500 Batman Pack** released in 1989 was the proud and joy of Commodore UK.
<br><br>
This very successfull - in terms of sale - bundle was the result of Mr. **David Pleasance**'s effort to promote the Amiga as an awesome choice for a home computer that could excel in video games and digital entertainment! I have also <a href="https://amigaposters.github.io/amiga%20500/own%20creation/posters/2021/04/29/amiga-500-batman-pack.html" target="_blank">another post</a> in my blog where I present a *could-be print ad* I created to promote this pack in the computer and video games magazines of the era.
<br><br>
The bundle was released as a sleeve over the standard Amiga 500 original packaging and I recreated the front cover for you to enjoy!
