Sounds just like one more marketing line but in the case of the Amiga it holds true!
<br><br>
When I stumbled upon the cover art of the game **Continuum** published on 1990 by **Data East** in the US, I immediately knew that my next Amiga poster would need to include these frame perspective and geometrical 3D elements. I’m a big fan of these gimmicks of the 80s graphic design style so its was love on first sight!
<br><br>
A friend on one of the largest online Amiga communities (the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/CommodoreAmiga/" target="_blank">Commodore Amiga Facebook group</a>) asked me to describe my process of (re)creating all those Amiga posters. Well, I have to say that, for me, the first step is to look at an image, photo or cover art that clicks to my imagination and in my mind connects with the Amiga era, my memories of it and my teenage years in mid 80s to mid 90s. After it enters my mind it can’t escape! I have a drawer in my hard drive called ‘*Ideas*‘ where I will put everything I like until the day comes that it will be part of a new poster design.
<br><br>
To no further delay enjoy my new poster advertising the Amiga’s many dimensions!
