When it comes to racing games for the Amiga the widely acclaimed **Lotus** series developed by **Magnetic Fields** is one of the best!
<br><br>
The series consists of three games based around the Lotus brand (officially licensed) published between 1990 and 1992 by **Gremlin Graphics**. The games shared a horizontal split-screen 2-player mode and the Amiga version featured nice graphics and smooth gameplay. All games gained very favourable reviews from the Amiga press upon release.

My artwork is a recreation of the original poster contained with the retail box of **Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge** (the 3rd game in the series). As can been seen this game allows the player to drive a Lotus M200 futuristic concept model that never made it into production!
