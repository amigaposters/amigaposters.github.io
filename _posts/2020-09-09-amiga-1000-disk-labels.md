The first Amiga came with a set of system disks that included the Kickstart, the Amiga Workbench, Amiga Basic as well as some extra software. 
<br><br>
These system disks had some eye catching labels that used the Amiga **double-tick** with various coloring effects. Here are these labels re-created for any of you that need to replace your original disks or make backup copies that look as nice as the originals. Simple print my image in self-adhesive paper and use the guides to cut your shiny new labels!
