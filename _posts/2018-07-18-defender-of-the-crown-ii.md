This wonderful original game from **Cinemaware** got a face-lift and some extra features towards an optical media release both on CDTV and AmigaCD32 supported by Commodore itself.
<br><br>
The fantastic and detailed pixel-art of **Jim Sachs** along with the atmospheric medieval music creates a gaming experience that was unprecedented on its time of release. Reading about the game on the computer magazines of the 80s I was a die-hard fan of it even before owning my Amiga! Thus, I knew I had to try a repro of this CD cover.
<br><br>
My images are quite detailed and as close to the originals – that I could find online – as possible.
