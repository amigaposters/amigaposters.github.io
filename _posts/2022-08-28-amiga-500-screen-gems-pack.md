The **Screen Gems** bundle with the **Amiga 500** computer was released in the fall of 1990 by Commodore UK.
<br><br>
This pack was clearly taregetting gamers and included four game titles, namely **Days of Thunder**, **Back to the Future II**, **The Night Breed** and **Shadow of the Beast II**. It was no coincidence that the first three games were based on hit movies that were released just a few months before the bundle was made available for purchase. Certainly this was the reason behind the pack naming! Along with the games Commodore bundled also the obligatory Amiga-hit drawing program **Deluxe Paint II**. 
<br><br>
The bundle was released as a sleeve over the standard Amiga 500 original packaging. Here I have recreated the sleeve's front cover for you to enjoy and feel a spark of nostalgia!
