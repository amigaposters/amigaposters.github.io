The end of the year is around the corner. So how about firing up **your Amiga**, grab that old **tank mouse** and get in the holidays mood!
<br><br>
For me is probably the most nostalgic part of the year as it was back in December of 1988 when I got a shiny new Amiga 500 home computer as a Christmas present. I still remember those Christmas and all the excitement of a 14-year old discovering the amazing capabilities of the Amiga! Wouldn’t be wonderful these holidays to find some free hours and enjoy again yourself having fun with those good old Amiga classics?
<br><br>
To that same holiday spirit I’ve created a wallpaper to decorate your desktop.
